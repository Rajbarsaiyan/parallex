                Adventure Time follows the adventures of a boy named Finn the Human (voiced by Jeremy Shada), and his
                best friend and adoptive brother Jake the Dog (John DiMaggio), who has magical powers to change shape
                and size at will.
                <br>
                <br> Pendleton Ward, the series' creator, describes Finn as a "fiery little kid with strong morals".

                Cycling, also, when on a two-wheeled bicycle, called bicycling or biking, is the use of cycles for
                transport, recreation, exercise or sport.
                <br>
                <br> People engaged in cycling are referred to as "cyclists", "bicyclists", or "bikers"

                What is Paragliding? Paragliding is a type of extreme sport found in the early 1980s by people
                interested in aerial sports, and it allows one to run off the slopes with free parachutes.
                <br>
                <br>
                Paragliding is generally more accessible than other extreme sports since it does not require a special
                take off or a landing track.

            </div>
            <p class="text">
                Surfing was invented by the Polynesians at least 4000 years ago. It has become a popular sport among
                both men and women of all ages. With lifestyles and regimens freer than those of most sports, surfers
                comprise a unique culture.
                <br>
                <br> Though surfing is practiced in many other Pacific nations, its center remains Hawaii, where many
                rounds of the international surfing championships (the ASP) are held annually. Surfing is popular in
                Australia, the US, and Northern Europe.
